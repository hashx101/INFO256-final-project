<h4> More Details </h4>
<p> For this task, you will be giving the system example-based feedback.</p>

<p> Type in words or quoted phrases ("like this") into the search box and click 
	the "Search" button to get matching sentences. You can give the system feedback by 
	marking sentences "relevant", "neutral", or "not relevant".
	Mark sentences as "relevant" if you think they match the theme. 
	Mark them "not relevant" if you think they don't match the theme. 
	Leave them as "Neutral" if you're not sure.
	You do not have to mark all the sentences you see, just as many or 
	as few as you decide.
</p>

<p> Once you've marked some sentences, the "Refine results" button tells this
	system to return a new list of results based on your feedback. The system tries to return sentences
	that are more like the ones you marked "relevant", and less like the 
	ones you marked "not relevant".
	You can continue the cycle as many times as you like by marking sentences 
	and refining results.
</p>

<p> You do not always have to give feedback. You can 
	search using the search box at any time. </p>

<p> The sentences you've marked will stay in a list on the right. If you change 
	your mind about a sentence,	click the "x" button next to it. 
	You can always change your mind back by marking the sentence again.</p>
