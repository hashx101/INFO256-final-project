<h4> More Details </h4>
<p> For this task, you will be using a search system to find examples of the
	theme. Type words or quoted phrases ("like this") into the search box and click 
	the "Search" button to get matching sentences. </p>
	
<p> Mark sentences as "relevant" if you think they match the theme.
	Otherwise, leave them as "neutral". The relevant sentences will appear in

	sentences as you think match the theme. </p>
